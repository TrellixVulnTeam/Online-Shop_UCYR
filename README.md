# Online-Shop

Site was made partly along the curse, but mostly i did it by myself.
Main features: html, css. responsive design, js.
Some elements where done useing slick slider. such as slider of product range(popular/ similar), but banner slider at home page was done manually 
in pure javascript

html:
Site consist of 3 pages: index, page of single product, and catalog which are mentioned in the header of the site
all pages are responsive.
css: while creating this site i was using preprocessor scss which was compiled by npm. in this project i used nesting, variables, mixins.

js: for slick slider and tabs i used jquery. This part was taken from the course, but to improve my skills i did banner slider on my own, 
tabs where also made manually but in another project.
Prodocts where not hardcoded. Each product card was generated using javascript to make this project closer to reall life project. 
I created few oblects for this purpose and each card was generated using data from this objects
